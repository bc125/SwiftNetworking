SwiftNetworking
===============

Swift networking code with named closures to see the effect on readability/comprehensibility compared to using in-place 'unnamed' closure expressions

This is made using the source code at https://github.com/subdigital/nsscreencast/blob/master/129-swift-json/json.swift
that is written using closure expressions.
